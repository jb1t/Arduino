# Automated Cat food feeder

It has been approximately 5 years now since I created an automated cat food feeder. I have two cats and at that time started getting into the maker space. Well I thought this would be a GREAT project for me!

Here is a [link](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Apbi_Kvsna1rjCgFPiBUqhv0UFdJ) to view some photos and videos of the project.

I added the Meow Mix jingle to play before it feeds the cats and true to [Pavlov's Law](https://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html) the cats come running when they hear the jingle play.

From time to time the servos will have a hard time turning and that just usually means it is time to clean them as food particles clog things up, but it has only happened a couple of times.
