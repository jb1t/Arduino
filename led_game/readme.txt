This project is a variation of my first project on the Arduino

The basics of the simple sketch is to be a binary adder... hook up your leds and resistors and just initialize the ledPins array. The hook up your potentiometer to read in the analog value and use that for your delay. Now you have a bit counter that speeds up/down when you turn the potentiometer.
