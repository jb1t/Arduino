The purpose of this project is to demonstrate lighting of LEDs and using a Tach switch.

The simple tach switch is the button you'll use in the game for input. You are supposed to push the button when it gets to the last light in the series. When you press the button whatever the current LED is will blink. If you pressed on the correct light you'll increment your score. If you press the button on the wrong LED you lose a life. You only have 3 lives before the game is over and reset. If you have serial port attached you'll the score output to the screen and what the high score ever time the game is reset.
